Data Stream
  $data is stream windows file explorer uses
  Alternate Data stream
    was exploite by having a file adding to itself until file system full
    with NTFS - will sart giving some tmp files then low priorities, if forces kernel crash
    can be used w antovirus and stuff to quarintine and signature virus
    sql database reqire alternate data streams
    win dows not show as used space
    see w/ dir /R
    Create w/
      cmd
      ' echo "Elden ring does not deserve GOTY" > calc.fuk:truth.txt
      #calc will not have alternate data stream, explorer will show file size same even with data written on it
      #.\calc.fuk will only load calc, not notepad/txt doc
      #Dir /R will show an alternate data streeam of the txt file connexted to calc, calc is same size but with a alt data stream of another size
      #writing to alternate data stream will change timstamo so will need to timestomp
      PS
      get-item .\calc -stream * #we know calc has ads, look at all stream of it
        finds it, then read w get-content .\calc.fuk -stream truth.txt
      gci $pwd | foreach-object { get-item $_.Fullname -stream * } | where {$_.stream -ne ':$DATA' }
        #finfd and give sinto on ads in current working dir
        print the info with an extra pipe and get-content...
