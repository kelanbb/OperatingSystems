  What am I allowed to do?
    sudo -l
  What is going on?
  What is that?
  Why is that happening?
  How is that happening?
  What is in there? (if file is human readable)
  
  netsowk acivity
    netstat
    ss
      sudo ss -ntlp
         port nubers instead of service its assuming, tcp, listening ports, process attatched to (need sudo)
         if see weird port number, can look at process, PPID, etc..
          can use htop
          can use lsof (not recommended, lookng at text files and static file stuff)
          can use top
          can use ps -elf (snapshot)
            can give options / commands on program
          PPID is 1
            could be (like) a service since ppid 1
            if on sysv
              look on init
            systemd system
              etc/systemd/system for services
              or lib/systemd/service
            PPID random number
              pslist --forest --context:3
                in forest tree see a CRON
                  (mdadom,popularity are legit)
                  mean cronjob
                    child proces sof main con process
                      user who runs it is the owner of process
                        check that user cronjob
                          sudo crontab -l -u student (if student is running CRON)
                          var/spool/cron/crontabs
                            user cronjobs
                      if root runs cronjob
                        etc/crontab
                        etc/cron.d
                        var/spool/cron/crontabs
                 if fix crontab and still persistance
                 locations of persitance
                  timers
                  service / processes /cronjobs
                  could check tmp
                  could check init (on sysv)
                  check configuation files on system
                    /etc/
                        bash.bashrc
                          system wide fiile for interactive non login shells; used for sstem wide profiles, all users on bash
                        profile
                          system wide file for interactive login shells; used for when you log in
                          if persistance in this file
                            first need to log in
                          profile.d for shell scripts..?? 
                         both of these can have scripts in them for when people log in
