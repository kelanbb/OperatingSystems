Create config file in .ssh folder
  vim .ssh/config
    Host linops
      HostName <ip>
      User <user>
      Port 22
  chmod 600 .ssh/linops
  Next, create private/public ssh key pair for auth
    ssh-keygen    #only time need to make new key is when on different box
    ssh-copy-id linops
  Connect with ssh linops
    exit with ctrl+d
  
Create alias to connect to linops and open terminator
  cat .bashrc     to see info on bashrc on current ws
  #use .bash_aliases to make alias
    vim .bash_aliases
      alias sshops sshops='ssh linops -X terminator&'
Source bashrc to see file
  source .bashrc
Connect w/ sshops


Awareness:
  hostname / uname
  whoami / id # figure out who you are

  sudo -l #what am I allowed to do
    (ALL : ALL) ALL means no limit, last ALL is all commands, inter ALL is what you can do to those commands..??
  #What's going on, what's that
      w / who # who else on box
      ps -elf #processes
  #Why is that happening / what is the direct cause of anything I found to note
  #How is that happening / overall machanism is happening or whats occuring to cause stuff
  #if end up on somethin human readable, whats in there

    /home   #default for users home directroy
    /usr    #univeral sytem recources, catchall for things/files that supposed to be used accross entire system, some binaries, documentation, some example files

Users and Groups
  tells who can do what
  /etc/passwd holds a list of all uers and passwords
    fields in /etc/passwd: user pw, uid, guid, comments, home dir, shell
  /etc/group holds groups on a  system
    fields: goup name,password, gid, users that use this group as a supplementary group, 
    get on specific user by cat /etc/passwd | grep <user>
  
Listing of files in a dir
  interested in permissions and groups/users
3 sections of permisions: UGO (Users, Groups, Other)
  ex if 750 permissions with student:student user:group ownership
    student user does all
    student group does read and execute
    anyone else can do nothing

SUID - bit when turned on, when this file is executed, executed as user who owns it. Perm 4000
  see where command is ran from with 'which'
    ex which passswd, then ls -lisa <which passwd> , comes back as -rwsr-xr-x , th s is saying can se wners (roots) permissiont to edit, but only you stuff / entries
SGUID - sam as SUID but with grouos
  find / -perm 2000 2>dev/null -exec ls -la {} \;
Sticky Bit - applied in shared directories where file itself can only be deleted by the owner, more than just the file can edit
