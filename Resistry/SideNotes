Registry can change product / activation codes on some software iw vmware ws pro oooyah


Windows tends to look at file extension beore signature
  cp Calc.exe $home\desktop
  cmd
    cd C:\users\andy.dryer\Desktop
    calc.exe calc.fuk #rename calc
    #when try to open calc.fuk, windows asks how to open since there is no .fuk in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Class\X505Enrollment.CalternativeName for ifle extensions
  Can 'new-item "hklm:\software\classes" -name ".fuk" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue | out-null
    Refraash regedit to see the key in hklm:\software\classe.fuk
    this measn we need toa ctually give the kay a value
      new-itemvalue "hklm:\software\classes\.fuk" -name '(Default)' -propertytype string -value 'exeFile' -force -errorexception silentlycontunie | out-null #need propertytype or else a string by default
        can also set-itemproperty......????? not as good bc sometimes wont allow
        There are multiple types of executables so need another key
          New-itemproperty "hklm:\software\classes\.fuk" -propertytype string -value 'application/x-msdownload' -force -erroraction silentlycontunie | out-null
    This is a symbollic link    

HKC stores a key for ech use tthats logged in

security account manager has hash and tokens

HKLM
  BCD - boot configuration daatastoreage, is boot config nfo for in
  SYStem
    CurrentControlSet - current control set
    ControlSet001 - older ver of currentcontrolset
      if tere was a setting only want to load sometimes but not all the times put here, will load if need be, good spot for persistance
