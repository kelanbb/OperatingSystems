A good portion of stuff might not be needed
ps and sysinterernals
  know commands to get sysinternals / slack commands
    net use * \\live.sysinternals.com\tools
      check drive net use or get-psdrive
View netowrk connection stuff
look for unuaual ports
  tcpview (sysint)
  netstat
    stat -anob
      b gives binary
  get-nettcpconnections

find process
  get-process
    get-process svshost | select name,id,path (gives relevent info you want on svchost processes)
  (sysinternals)
    process-explorer
    autoruns gives lots and lots
  taskmanager
  
auditing and logging
  things that are relevant and places to check for artifacts
    recyclebin
    bam
    prefetch
      get-childitem -path C:\Windows\prefetch\
        scrol through look
    userassist
      get-itemproperty "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersin\Explorer\UserAssist\{ahjbdhadlsablfhkjdfh-9926...9EA}\count"
      take note of the output
      know regkey path
      ROT13 encryption
      userasssit guid have sinc all same
      
      
#1 location to wite doown since things in here run utomatically
      runkeys
        machine and user
        check w/ reg-query
        get-item
          iff see message saying file doesnt exist when looking for file, that is suspicious
          
scheduled tasks (for persistance)
  taskscheduler
    just look for custom jobs, not microsoft ones
  autoruns
  blank statemnts
  
 Profiles (day1)
  powershell profule
  users profiles
  all users all hosts
  check to see if exist with test-path
    tells erather profile madee or not
    depending on how open ps detemines how profiles checked
    SLACK has script to check
    
Terminology in question
  what is mechanism
    what casued something to happen
      ie file in runkey for malware (persistanec)
      
      
NOGO ]  
  gc or cat, get strings binaries
  dll grabbing stuff
  Names are okay for the files and binaries, dll and stuff
  NOT looking at drivers, dll, binaries, handles
