Rootkits
  drivers are easiest wa to install rootkits, by injeting / reverse engineering
  3 types
    Rootkit
    Bootkit - rootkit specificslly targeting boot process
    ...?
  
 host before anything, like bios
 
 
 BIOS will only use MBR, UEFI uses GPT for this course
  BIOS
    MBR (Master Boot Record)
      (if not MBR found , will not work / load)
      active partition identified in the partition table
      partition boot record (PBR) on the active partition is loaded 
      code in the PBR loads bootmgr
        bootmgr/bootmfrfw.efi
          replaced pre-vista NTLDR
      first 512 bytes on boot partition..?
        only allows up to 4?
      
    Windows Boot manager (bootmgr)
      manages the boot process
    BCD
      boot configuration Data store
      replaced the boot.ini
        boot menu options and settings on ESD (EFI System partition) \EFI\Microsoft\boot\BCD
    OS Loader
      (winload.exe) or (winresume.exe)
        loads kernel (ntoskrnl.exe)
          winload is used in cold starts, box fully powered off. (win10 by default uses Fast boot, Fast boot uses winresume instead of winload, hybrid, not really needed for SSD)
          winresume is used when computer is put to sleep, not sutned off, doesn;t have to load OS again, just in hybernation
            hybernation works by taking everything running in ram, entirety of OS and everything running, writes to disk (hybernate file in C drive), then powers off (shurdown is slow), when loads reads the winresume.exe and looks at hybernation file and loads everything
  UEFI
    GPT (GUI Partition Table)
      UEFI does nto check if GPT exists like BIOS would with MBR, just chescks for drive...?
    UEFI Boot Manager (bootmgrfe.efi)
      manages boot process
    BCD
    OS Loader
