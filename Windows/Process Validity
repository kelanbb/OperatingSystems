Goals
-----
understandinh the heiarchy of processes / services -- understand what's normal and whats abnormal
find malicious processes that mask themselvs as normal processes
apply solution to finding malicous process and services
understanf the service configuration post-modification behaivior prior to challenge

Process validity - 


Discovering hidden process, services, and finding normal and abnormal activity -



majority fo time in dll hikacking, not writing to disk, mostly memory. actually need to look for process validty and services.


difference between process and service:
svchost is proces that hosts all services
process requires interaction to start, current ecectution of code running
  requires interaction in some form
service runs in the background with minimal to no interaction (only interaction is really staty, stop, restart)
  background, quiet

DLL
----
library that contains 'pointers' to rescources available for other programs to interact with
  functions, executables, other libraries, etc

GET PROCCESSES
---------------

tasklist
  get-member tasklist
  is a binary, built into windows, gives tasks process

get-process
  defalt gives more than tasklist

task manager
  taskmgr
  can have hidden running process bc of apit stuff
  
get-ciminstance
  get-siminstance win32_process | measure 
  vs
  get-prcess | measure # to find the difference in lenth of discovered process between these
  handle is rescource progam is using reaching out to another thing / trying to access
  get-ciminstance win32_process | select * # for a better format
  
  
get-cimclass -classname * | measure ????
  cim class is grouping to help the kernel manage
