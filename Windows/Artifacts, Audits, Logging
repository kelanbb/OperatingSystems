Windows Artifacts
=======================================
Artifacts (General, major ones, not all)
  List
    UserAssist
    Windows Background Activity Moderator (BAM)
    Recycle Bin
    Prefetch
    Jump Lists
    Recent Files
    Browser Artifacts
  Track user of system activity with them
  DEF:
    Objects or areas within computer system that contain info relevent to activities performed on the system by a user
    Anything left behind on OS from code execution
      Artifacts good for forensic analysis
      Allows for historic analysis on machine
        Can look for persistance with artifacts, just need to now heere to look
        
Get User SID
------------
  What users are we looking at, use SID to find
    When going to machine get draw every account thats logged into machine
  Many artifacts require operator to use a Security Identifier (SID)
    to dig in user specific registry locations to enumerate the artifact info.
        get-wmiobject win32_useraccount | select name,sid (PowerShell)
          get-wmiobject shows local / domain Users and SID
        Get-LocalUser | select Name,SID (PowerShell)
          Get-localUser shows local users and SID on system
        wmic useraccount get name,sid (CMD.EXE ONLY)
          wmic useraccount will show local users and SID
        
USERASSIST
----------
  Looking for shortcut
  Userrassist uslly only for current user
  To check all users:
    HKU ... ??
    get-item 'registry::hkey_users\*\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\userassist\{GUID (these 2 same aross machine)}\Count'
      or get-itemproperty _______ (expands it out)
  UserAssit registry key
    tracks the GUI-based programs that were ran by particulat user
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist\{GUID}\Count\
      Encoded in ROT13
    GUID
      represents a perticular file extension
      2 same ones for windows:
        CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA 
          A list of applications, files, links, and other objects that have been accessed

          Lists the Shortcut Links used to start programs
        Can be decoded with cyberchef (ROT13)
  View executable files run
    Get-ItemProperty 'REGISTRY::HKEY_USERS\*\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist\{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}\Count'
    Get-ItemProperty "Registry::Hkey_Users\*\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist\{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}\Count"
      all users
    Get-ItemProperty "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist\{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}\Count"
      one, current, user  
 View shortcut files executes
    Get-ItemProperty 'REGISTRY::HKEY_USERS\*\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist\{F4E57C4B-2036-45F0-A9AB-443BCFE33D9F}\Count'
  
lmk
  good for persistance
  shortcut to program
    can be used to run program and othe things after

WINDOWS BACKGROUND ACTIVITY MODERATOR (BAM)
------------------------------------------
  BAM is windows service
    Controls activity of background applications
  Provides
    full path of an executable
      can be good to know to spot any abnormal file locations
    last execution date/time
  Location
    HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\UserSettings (1709-1803)
    HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\State\UserSettings (1809-newer)
  Get-Itemproperty 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\UserSettings\*'
    (Windows 1709 & 1803)
    Get full file path of whatever exe ran and last time ran, and who ran it
      Will have \device\HardDiskVolume1 format instead of C:\
  Get-Itemproperty 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\state\UserSettings\*'
    (Windows 1809 and newer)
  Show all users BAM artifacts / Single User
    wmic useraccount  get caption,sid | more
      Can set SID
       then
      HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\State\UserSettings\S-1-5-21-1584283910-3275287195-1754958050-1005'
        put tgt user SID to show BAM artifact for user
        
RECYCLE BIN
-----------
  Important location on windows file system
   can help accomplish forensic investigation
  Content identified by (In Recycle Bin):
    SID - determine which user deleted it
    Timestamp - When deleted
    $RXXXXXX - content of deleted files
    $IXXXXXX - original PATH and name
  Location
    C:\$Recycle.bin
      hidden system folder
  gci 'C:\$RECYCLE.BIN' -Recurse -Verbose -Force | select *
   or
    gci 'C:\$RECYCLE.BIN' -Recurse -Verbose -Force | select FullName
      Find Contents of RB
  gci 'C:\$RECYCLE.BIN' -Recurse -Force
    will look at all user's/SID contents
  Match SID to user
    wmic useraccount where 'sid="S-1-5-21-1584283910-3275287195-1754958050-1005"' get name
  Read content of files in RB:
    Get-Content 'C:\$Recycle.Bin\S-1-5-21-1584283910-3275287195-1754958050-1005\$R8QZ1U8.txt'
      Use match above to get the user
  gci "C:\`$Recycle.bin" -recurse -Force
    look at other users recycle bins
 gci 'C:\Recycle.Bin' -force -recurse | foreach-object {if (($_.extension) -like ".txt") { if ($_.name -like "`$R*") { Write-host $_.name -NonewLine ; Write-Host "--->" -Forgroundcolor green -NoNewline ; Get-content $_.fullname } } } 
      
PREFETCH
--------
  Prefetch files are created by operating system when application is run from specific location for first time
    for speeding up spplication startup process
  Only shows files that have ran
    access, launched , who launched
    pointers to where its from
      also keeps copy of entire binary
    prefetch file for calc.exe would appear as CALC.EXE-0FE8F3A9.pf
      0FE8F3A9 is a hash of the path from where the file was executed
    Location:
      C:\Windows\Prefetch
    can reveal evidence of program execution got particular use or from a particular location
  gci -Path 'C:\Windows\Prefetch' -ErrorAction Continue | select * | select -first 5

JUMP LISTS
-----------
  Windows 7-10 taskbar
    made to allow users to 'jump' / access items the have frequently or recently used quickly and easily
  Stores in specific users profile
  gci -Recurse C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent -ErrorAction Continue | select FullName, LastAccessTime | ft -wrap
    look at jump list
    Other ways
      can do lastaaccesstime, creationtime, name
        timeline analysis
    can gc <file> on anything found
      can show absolte path of the file
  Location
    C:\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations
      (C:\Users\king\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent)
    In Explorer:  
    C:\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations
