Memory Analysis can allow the gathering if special artifacts that are not on disk
Volatility install can allow snapshot for memory
  Volatility is an open source memory analysis tool for Linux, Windows, Mac, and Android systems
  It analyzes man file types including: raw dumps, crash dumps, VMware dumps (.vmem), virtual box dumps, and many others.
SKILL 3: Memory acquisition, Profile Creation, and Memory Dump Analysis

MEMORY
------
Volatile Memory
  Non-persistent
  Requires power to maintain the stored information;
  it retains its contents while powered on but when the power is interrupted, the stored data is immediately lost
    RAM
Non-Volatile Memory
  Persistent
  Does not require a continuous power supply to retain the data stored in a computing device
    HDD
    USB
    
Data that has not been stored on disk yet is present in memory
Files that have been deleted or modified can be scraped from RAM and used as evidence or for timelining an attack
  Examples:
    Bash history is written to .bash_history once the terminal session is terminated, however each command that has been ran during the current terminal session resides in RAM and can be viewed using the bash plugin
    If the ~/.bash_history has been deleted, using the same method as above we can still retrieve all commands executed
    Logs that have been deleted or modified can be read and scraped from memory using the mfind mcat & mls plugins

MEMORY ANALYSIS   

ORDER OF VOLATILITY - THE HALFLIFE OF DATA
  1.CPU registers, cache
  2.Routing table, ARP cache, process table, kernel stats, memory
      gone when powered off
  3.Temporary file systems
      files on disk to be used for that session of computer running
  4.Disk
  5.Remote logging and monitoring data
      Infomation off system and stored smoewhere else, not likely to change when pc powered off
  6.Physical configuration, network topology
  7.Archival media - backups
  
Each operating system has its own memory acquisition tool called Persistent Memory (pmem)
  Linpmem
  Winpmem
  OSXpmem
  
Volatility Program
  Uses profiles
    profiles provide a memory layout   
  EX:
    .\volatility......exe -h
      help
    -f FILENAME, --filename=FILENAE 
      filename to open when using image
    --profile=WinXPSP2x86
      if know what profile, can specify
    --plugins=PLUGINS
      has plugins to extract infomration looking for
    if don't know plugin or profle, shows plusings at bottom of help
      imageinfo can recommend profile
      .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" imageinfo
        dont know profile so run this on file
    Pslistplugin gives processes running
      .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profileWINXPSP2x86 pslist
        look for anything questionable
          can look at names and PID and PPID to start
    Pstree plugin shows process in a tree heiarchy
    procdump
      dump a process to an executable file sample
        can use on virustool
          only send hash
            get-filehash <file>
      .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 procdump -p 1640 -D .
        procdump on PID 1640 and into directory . (pwd)
    memdump plugin  
     get memory dumo fo a particulat process
      see what process was doing
     .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 memdump -p 1640 -D .
        then..
      net use * \\live.sysinternals.com\tools      
       z:\strings.exe -accepteula "1640.dmp" > 1640.txt
        can open w/ np++, search for things like ips or anything bad
          if find ip address can use volitility
     connections
      prints list of open connections
      .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 connections
     connscan
      pool of tcp connections made in general
        active and recently closed
      .\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 connscan
        can ip lookup
     looking for processes
      pslist
      pstree
      psscan
        give phyical memory address of processes
     see what dll process is using
      dlllist
        see list of whats using
      dlldump
        grab dll
     Netowork srtifacts
      connection
      connscan
     Registry analysis
      hivedump
        dump hive
      hivelist
        list all hives
      dumpregistry
        dump whole registry
      b
